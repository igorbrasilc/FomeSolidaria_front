##  :clipboard: Description

This is an authoral project based on <a href="https://igrejacasadooleiro.com.br/fome-solid%C3%A1ria">Fome Solid√°ria charity project</a> from Igreja Casa Do Oleiro. 
People that attend the church donate food to supply people in need, and the control of the inventory was made with an Excel sheet. 
*This app* is meant to replace that with a more user-friendly interface and better organization. Through it, you can keep track of the total amount of donations filtered by category, register new
people in the database and new donations. Check for family members and get a timeline of the number of donations registered to that family.

**PS.: the project is meant to be used only by admins, so there is no sign up interface. If you want to check it out just login by:**

```
login: admin
password: admin
```
